*Arriving Somewhere But Not Here* is the title of a track on the 2005 album [*Deadwing*](https://porcupinetree.com/recordings/deadwing-2/) from the band [*Porcupine Tree*](https://porcupinetree.com). It's 12 minutes long and goes all over the place. I love the track and the album!

I like the title it as a subtitle for this blog, because it can mean so many things. For example: you, as a casual reader, somehow ended up here, but it's probably not where you planned to be. Also, I don't know where I'm going with this blog at all.

## Why this blog?

I'm not on Twitter. I'm not on Instagram. I'm not on Facebook. I'm not on any other social network. I just don't care about them. I think that all they are is a big waste of time. There's nothing wrong with that! I'm a great fan of wasting my time on things. But, I'd rather waste them on things that give me joy.

Like keeping a blog.

Of course I know nobody is blogging anymore. I'm clearly getting old and am out of touch with reality. I don't care. I'm keeping this blog for me, myself and I in the first place. I like fiddling on it. I like tweaking it. It gives me joy. If some of the content on this blog gives somebody else some joy as well, then all the better. If not, also fine!
